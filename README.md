# Collection of Machine Learning Algorithms and Stuff

## Intro :smiley_cat:

This is a repository for the [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kainosai2019bham).

The aim is to classify images into one of 8 different categories, trained using training data provided at [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kainosai2019bham/data) and evaluated on their test data.


## Code + Files

The only provided code file is a cats_dogs_and_more.ipynb code notebook which runs the classifier and saves results to the results.csv file.
